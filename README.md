# `📈 DyCodeEval`

This repository contains the main implementation of **DyCodeEval**, introduced in our ICML 2025 paper:
*“DyCodeEval: Dynamic Benchmarking of Reasoning Capabilities in Code Large Language Models Under Data Contamination.”*

**DyCodeEval** proposes a novel **dynamic benchmarking framework** for evaluating code large language models (Code LLMs). It leverages a **multi-agent cooperation** strategy to **rewrite existing benchmarks** at evaluation time, producing programming problems that are: 1. Semantically equivalent, 2. Diverse, and 3. Non-deterministic. This dynamic generation process helps **mitigate data contamination** and provides a more robust and faithful assessment of a model's reasoning capabilities.
